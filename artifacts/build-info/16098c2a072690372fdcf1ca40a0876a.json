Reggie provides Vera a public key\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n *\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\n * @dev from the output space.\n *\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\n * @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\n * @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev USAGE\n *\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\n * @dev shown:\n *\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\n * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\n * @dev       }\n * @dev   }\n *\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it\n * @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\n * @dev subscription management functions).\n * @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\n * @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\n * @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\n *\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\n *\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\n * @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\n *\n * @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\n * @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\n * @dev with which randomness request.\n * @dev See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\n *\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n * @dev differ.\n *\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n *\n * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\n * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\n * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\n * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\n *\n * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\n * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\n * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\n * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n *\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n *\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\n */\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\n\n  /**\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\n   */\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.

Reggie provides Vera a public key\n @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\n @dev from the output space.\n @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\n @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\n @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\n @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\n @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev USAGE\n @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\n @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\n @dev shown:\n @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\n @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\n @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\n @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\n @dev       }\n @dev   }\n @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\n @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it\n @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\n @dev subscription management functions).\n @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\n @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\n @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\n @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\n @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\n @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\n @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\n @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\n @dev with which randomness request.\n @dev See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\n @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\n @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n @dev differ.\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\n @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\n @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\n @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\n @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\n @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\n @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\n @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\n @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software)."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":57,"linearizedBaseContracts":[57],"name":"VRFConsumerBaseV2","nameLocation":"5351:17:0","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"errorSelector":"1cf993f4","id":8,"name":"OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill","nameLocation":"5379:25:0","nodeType":"ErrorDefinition","parameters":{"id":7,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":4,"mutability":"mutable","name":"have","nameLocation":"5413:4:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":8,"src":"5405:12:0","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":3,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5405:7:0","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":6,"mutability":"mutable","name":"want","nameLocation":"5427:4:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":8,"src":"5419:12:0","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":5,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5419:7:0","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"5404:28:0"},"src":"5373:60:0"},{"constant":false,"id":10,"mutability":"immutable","name":"vrfCoordinator","nameLocation":"5462:14:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":57,"src":"5436:40:0","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":9,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5436:7:0","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"private"},{"body":{"id":20,"nodeType":"Block","src":"5593:43:0","statements":[{"expression":{"id":18,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftHandSide":{"id":16,"name":"vrfCoordinator","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":10,"src":"5599:14:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"nodeType":"Assignment","operator":"=","rightHandSide":{"id":17,"name":"_vrfCoordinator","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":13,"src":"5616:15:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"src":"5599:32:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"id":19,"nodeType":"ExpressionStatement","src":"5599:32:0"}]},"documentation":{"id":11,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5481:72:0","text":" @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract"},"id":21,"implemented":true,"kind":"constructor","modifiers":[],"name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":14,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":13,"mutability":"mutable","name":"_vrfCoordinator","nameLocation":"5576:15:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":21,"src":"5568:23:0","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":12,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5568:7:0","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"5567:25:0"},"returnParameters":{"id":15,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"5593:0:0"},"scope":57,"src":"5556:80:0","stateMutability":"nonpayable","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"documentation":{"id":22,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5640:686:0","text":" @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.

Each time Vera provides a seed to\\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\\n *\\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\\n * @dev from the output space.\\n *\\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\\n * @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\\n * @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev USAGE\\n *\\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\\n * @dev shown:\\n *\\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\\n * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\\n * @dev       }\\n * @dev   }\\n *\\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash).

If your contract must store the response (or\\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\\n *\\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\\n */\\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\\n   */\\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.

randomness\\n * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not\\n * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key\\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\\n *\\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\\n * @dev from the output space.\\n *\\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\\n * @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\\n * @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev USAGE\\n *\\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\\n * @dev shown:\\n *\\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\\n * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\\n * @dev       }\\n * @dev   }\\n *\\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it\\n * @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\\n * @dev subscription management functions).\\n * @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\\n * @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\\n * @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\\n *\\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\\n *\\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\\n * @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\\n *\\n * @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\\n * @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\\n * @dev with which randomness request.\\n * @dev See \\\"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\\\" for principles to keep in mind,\\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\\n *\\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\\n * @dev differ.\\n *\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\\n *\\n * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\\n * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\\n * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\\n * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\\n *\\n * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\\n * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\\n * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\\n * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\\n *\\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\\n */\\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\\n   */\\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.
